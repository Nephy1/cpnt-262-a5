# REST API Assignment 

- Tried to add multiple query parameters and could not seem to get a title or string to cooperate.
- Found myself easily getting lost.
- Confused mostly on all the js files and what goes where.
- Struggling on getting errors when api endpoint !== an actual ID. I wasn't able to complete this part unfortunately.

## Heroku
- Had little problems with Heroku thankfully. Initially had my server in limbo until I fixed my port issue. Cleared it right up. Was actually alot easier to do than I had thought.

## Mongo DB
- I wasn't able to get the object data to push through Mongoose into MongoDB. I had to enter it manually like we were shown in class.

### File Management
- I know my JavaScript file management / exports are very messy. It's a work in progress and seems like a whole other beast on it's own.

### Overall Thoughts
- In all honesty I'm happy in a sense that I've learned to do this much in a short amount of time.Not necessarily happy with the outcome of this assignment in particular. I would be if my file management and exports weren't so all over the map. I know theres a ton of improvement to be made and always will be, but for starters I'm suprised I managed to make it this far without completely dropping the ball.
